A simple demonstration how Java can encrypt and save an object in a file and decrypt it again. An object (Bank in this project, containing dummy accounts with properties like balance, account # etc.) gets converted to a byte array and every single byte gets casted from signed to unsigned and saved as an array of ints representing 8 bits. These get switched using a randomly created bytearray and its bits in a onetime-pad like XOR cypher. The key is saved as a string in a file for demo purposes. Decryption works the same way after decoding the password and XOR-ing back in the same manner. The object Bank becomes recreated after it was decrypted. The project contains a factory class to create random Account objects.
